# Create a MongoDB container and connect it to the Node.js container.

- First, I created a directory and initialized it with Git.
- Then, I ran `npm init -y` to create a package.json file,
-  followed by `npm install mongoose`.
  
```
npm init -y
npm install mongoose
```
  

I installed MongoDB first on Windows and then on Linux using WSL2, which was a lengthy process (refer to "Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu - MongoDB Manual v8.0").
I started MongoDB using the command:
```
sudo systemctl start mongo
```
Here is the index.js file:

Next, I created a `.dockerignore` file and added `node_modules` to prevent it from being included in the Docker image.

After creating the image and running the container, I encountered an error because MongoDB was not installed inside the container.

**Note**:This is because mongo is not installed within the container.

**To run both containers together, I used Docker Compose by creating a `docker-compose.yml` file.**

Then I  executed:
```
docker compose up --build
```

An error occurred because the Node.js app didnâ€™t know where to find the MongoDB database; the connection URL needed to be updated. I replaced "localhost" with the name of the database service.

After updating the database URL, I ran MongoDB, successfully connecting both containers.
